Project Overview:
  Custom Search Engine (Python):
    Youâ€™ll develop a search engine in Python (using Flask or FastAPI) that processes queries locally.
    It will index content (or return static results for now) and return relevant search results for each query.

  Qt-Based Web Browser:
    A web browser built using Qt WebEngine that allows for multiple tabs, navigation, and custom features.
    Requires a Qt framework with QWebEngine
    The browser will be configured to search the internet using your local search engine instead of relying on third-party search engines.

Outcome:
A self-hosted search engine and a custom web browser that communicates with it, allowing users to search the internet locally through the search engine.
